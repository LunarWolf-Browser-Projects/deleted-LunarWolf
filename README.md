# This project is no longer active

I deeply appreciated the BrowserBase project and the work its developers put into it. When I first started working on this project, I didn’t fully understand or look into the licensing terms as thoroughly as I do now. Over time, I’ve come to better understand the importance of these aspects, and this experience has been a significant learning opportunity for me.

While my project was intended as a continuation of their work, I now recognize the importance of respecting the original developers’ contributions and the legal nuances involved. Out of respect for their efforts, I have decided to take the project down. Moving forward, I will focus on creating something better, built from the ground up, or with something that is more publicly free, idk how to explain that part. This decision reflects my commitment to avoiding any potential misunderstandings or conflicts. To honor the developers, I have removed the previous files and replaced them with this branch and README to explain my reasoning.

+ I plan to work on projects that are either explicitly open-source with clear licensing or entirely original creations of my own. This approach ensures I steer clear of any legal or ethical uncertainties.

+ For clarity, my intention was never to claim the original project as my own. I explicitly stated in my repository that my efforts were a continuation of the project. However, with a better understanding of the situation now, I feel it is important to take this step.

To the developers of the original project, I sincerely apologize for any distress my actions may have caused or if they appeared disrespectful in any way. I have the utmost respect for your work and contributions. My only goal was to continue the project and support its development. I deeply regret any missteps and have grown significantly from this experience. Thank you for your understanding.

# NOTE
i did not get any donations of any kind from the project even tho i gave that as an option from people who wanted to support me working on the project, one again i am deeply sorry.

# Update
I have a new project in progress, but for the time being enjoy the image converter project with the lunarwolf branding, its built from the ground up, heres the link: https://github.com/LunarWolf-Browser-Projects/LunarWolf-image-converter

# another update
I have come to realize there were additional issues in my previous project, which had been forked by others. To all licensors of Wexond and Google, I sincerely apologize. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Moving forward, I will double-check all licensing requirements to ensure compliance. Once again, I am deeply sorry.

My intent was never to steal anything or upset anyone—I simply wanted to help and create something meaningful. To address the problems I’ve caused, I reviewed active forks of the project and forked their versions. I replaced the problematic files with their original ones and removed other problematic elements.

Additionally, I recalled that my last project, before officially transitioning to this repository and renaming it to LunarWolf, was a fork within the main repository rather than being a standalone repository (though it was also a forked repo).

i really do want to put this behind me as of moving forward and take this as an oppertunity to never make these kind of decisions again, once again, i am deeply regretful and sorry for everything

i am forking the other users fork of my old fork, and fixing there issues in it

to others who may be reading this, the reasioning for all the unorginizing in this README is because i am still learning in terms of this whole situation, and for every problem that was there (hopefully i have fully done what i can at this point) to fix anything and to show how truly regretful and sorry i am for this whole delima, and i really want to move forward, but all of this is effecting me mentally, so i am doing what i can to fix everything that i think of that could go wrong

as iv said many times, i am deeply deeply sorry :(

NOTE: this is what i have documented about this whole situation so sorry if its unorginized and i wanted to make this public to show i really do care.

Thank you for your understanding.
